## Founding Principle
Security before automation.  
Contain agents before granting capability.  
Log everything. Trust nothing by default.  
Human operator remains final authority.

---

## Phase Alignment
Phase 1 → Security + Containment  
Phase 2 → Controlled Agent Assistance  
Phase 3 → Scaled Intelligence + Revenue Systems  
Phase 4 → Self-Optimizing Operator Ecosystem

---

## Core Operator Rule
If future-us cannot understand why we made a move,
the move was incomplete.

Document reasoning. Always.
